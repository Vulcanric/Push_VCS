## The goals of the **push** command:
* To limits the time it takes to type
```bash
$ git add file
$ git commit -m <COMMIT_MSG>
$ git push
```
when trying to upload projects and source codes to GitHub.
* Make use of options that enhances the use of the command; such as:
	- -v, --verbose:	By default push doesn't display information, but it does when this opition is specified.
	- -s, --status		Prints the git status of project
	- -h, --help, ?:	Displays help informations on how to use it.
	- -ver, --version:	Displays the version and make year of this command.
	- and others...
* It is not meant to replace the `git` VCS, but to enhance it.
